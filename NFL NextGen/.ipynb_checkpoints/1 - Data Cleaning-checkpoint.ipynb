    "# 2019 NFL Big Data Bowl - Part 1: Data Cleaning\n",
    "This set of notebooks will go through a past Kaggle competition known as the NFL Big Data Bowl. The data bowl this time focuses on **running plays**, and specifically, how far a running play will go. We've all watched the games on television, and during plays, once the running back gets the ball, we sometimes think \"Oh that play is going nowhere\" or \"That's a touchdown\". How are we making these decisions? Presumably, a standard armchair spectator is looking at the blocking that is taking place in the offensive line. These sorts of cues are what we hope to capture when we analyze the running plays. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks will be arranged into parts that will take us through the various analyses that I perform. With any project, the data cleaning will always come first, to make sure the data can be effectively analyzed. This includes getting rid of duplicates, dropping missing data, splitting columns, and fixing data types. After this comes exploratory data analysis (EDA)."

    "Looking at the stats, the data is mostly clean on the key points. The biggest offenders are columns pertaining to the weather during the game. We can always use more reliable external sources to obtain what the weather was that day, so these are not important to the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **stadium type** tells us what the stadium environment is like. For example, is it outdoors/indoors, in a dome, have a retractable roof? The only place where this would effect our prediction, is if the stadium was outdoors, and it was raining pretty heavily, which would make players slip around (the 2011 \"Monsoon Bowl\" between the Jaguars and Panthers is a good example). However, this is a relative rarity that may happen 1 or 2 times a season, and so training in these specific conditions will not be productive. Additionally, we also have the stadium and turf type itself, so even if we were to include the weather, the model would ideally learn that in some stadiums the weather has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next variable is **field position**. This tells us which side of the field the possession team is on. I would say this is heavily important, especially since this determines the distance you are from the endzone. Additionally, the **yard line** is listed as a number between 0-50, so we would absolutely need the side to fully determine where the ball is. Therefore, we will remove all rows where we don't have the field position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other columns with low amounts will also have their rows removed, as those as datapoins which are quite important with respect to the running game. For example, it's much easier to block with 3 tight ends instead of the base 1. Personnel packages also let defenses infer one way or the other.\n",

However, this column can only take one of two values, \"home\" or \"away\". Thus, it's better if we code this as a categorical variable. The same would be a true for a number of other categories. Additionally, the default number data type is 64 bit, of which none of our values are that precise, so we can also save a bit on memory."
