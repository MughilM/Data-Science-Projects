    "This is the second notebook in a series where I partake in the 2019 Big Data Bowl competition on Kaggle. The first notebook dealt with cleaning the datasets to produce 3 different files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each player's physical characteristics (height, weight, etc.)\n",
    "- Each player's positions and speeds on each play\n",
    "- Each play's properties (down, distance, yards rushed, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be examining each of these files in order to get a deeper understanding of the data. In the end, the goal of exploratory data analysis is to show information that could be useful when completing the task at hand. In this case, we are ultimately trying to predict how many yards a given rushing play will go for, based on information at the time of handoff."

    "Couple things about this plot. The hypotenuse of this triangular plot shows all the times when a runner rushed for a touchdown at that position. Additionally, you may notice there are more points on the 25-yard line, and the 40-yard line to some extent. The reason is that whenever there is a touchback on the kickoff, the team starts at their own 25-yard line. Also, when a kickoff goes out of the bounds, that's a penalty on the kicking team, and the ball is spotted at the 40-yard line. The main things we take away from here is that **solely using the field position of the rushing play isn't enough, and other things must be taken into account.**"

    "### Distance to First Down\n",
    "The distance to a first down also matters. This mainly applies to short yardage situations, typically less than 4 yards or so. If you need 2 yards to keep the drive alive, why design for a long run when instead you can send in some big guys to push forward for the first down? Hopefully the next plot can show this...Instead of showing raw counts for how many plays were rushing plays per down and distance, we'll show **percentage**. The reason is that since you get a 1st and 10 whenever a new set of downs is established, it will cause an overabundance of the number of plays. There will also be a dropoff with distancecs greater than 10 yards because these can only occur either through a loss on the previous play, or through a penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll look at **all the plays** and see how many yards they've went for, then we'll look at the percentage of rushing plays as the distance increases."

    "## The Success of a Play\n",
    "As you might have guessed from the previous plots, there are many variables that affect how many yards go for. However, depending on the situation, the number of yards gained could have differing importance. For example, **gaining 3 yards on a 3rd and 2 is much more successful than gaining 3 yards on a 1st and 10**, because the former results in a first down to keep the drive alive. That isn't to say that you *have* to get a first down for a play to be successful. For example, gaining 5 yards on that 1st and 10 could be seen as successful as it could make 2nd and 3rd down much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in 1988, Pete Palmer, Bob Carroll, and John Thorn published a statistics book called *The Hidden Game of Football.* In it, they took apart the current notions of football stats, especially quarterback rating, and developed their own method of breaking down plays. Almost all of their statistics revolves around **yards**. Their notion of a successful play is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> On first down, a play is considered a success if it gains 45 percent of needed yards; on second down, a play needs to gain 60 percent of needed yards; on third and fourth down, only by gaining a first down (or touchdown) is considered success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, there have been many improvements to their methods that have been refined (see the reasoning behind Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) by [Football Outsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/methods)) but for our purposes, this success/failure breakdown should work reasonably well to measure how different aspects affect the yards gained, without worrying about the situational environment too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will add this information to our play-by-play level data, and doing so requires a few lines of code. Why didn't we do this in the data cleaning stage, you ask? Because any model might come up with a more complex method of combining the situation. In any case, we will input directly into the column `\"Success\"` or `\"Failure\"`."

At first thought, it makes sense that as the weight of the offensive line increases, the more successful a play gets, because the linemen theoretically are able to push everyone forward, which greatly affects whether the running back runs for a loss or gain.\n",

    "To capture this, we can take the **total weight** of the offensive line, and plot it against the yards gained. However, there's an important disclaimer for the plots that follow. The offensive line is not the only ones that might be blocking. You might have a fullback, or a big tight end as well, so keep that in mind.\n",
