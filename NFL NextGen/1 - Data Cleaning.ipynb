    "# 2019 NFL Big Data Bowl - Part 1: Data Cleaning\n",
    "This set of notebooks will go through a past Kaggle competition known as the NFL Big Data Bowl. The data bowl this time focuses on **running plays**, and specifically, how far a running play will go. We've all watched the games on television, and during plays, once the running back gets the ball, we sometimes think \"Oh that play is going nowhere\" or \"That's a touchdown\". How are we making these decisions? Presumably, a standard armchair spectator is looking at the blocking that is taking place in the offensive line. These sorts of cues are what we hope to capture when we analyze the running plays. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks will be arranged into parts that will take us through the various analyses that I perform. With any project, the data cleaning will always come first, to make sure the data can be effectively analyzed. This includes getting rid of duplicates, dropping missing data, splitting columns, and fixing data types. After this comes exploratory data analysis (EDA)."

    "Looking at the stats, the data is mostly clean on the key points. The biggest offenders are columns pertaining to the weather during the game. We can always use more reliable external sources to obtain what the weather was that day, so these are not important to the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **stadium type** tells us what the stadium environment is like. For example, is it outdoors/indoors, in a dome, have a retractable roof? The only place where this would effect our prediction, is if the stadium was outdoors, and it was raining pretty heavily, which would make players slip around (the 2011 \"Monsoon Bowl\" between the Jaguars and Panthers is a good example). However, this is a relative rarity that may happen 1 or 2 times a season, and so training in these specific conditions will not be productive. Additionally, we also have the stadium and turf type itself, so even if we were to include the weather, the model would ideally learn that in some stadiums the weather has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next variable is **field position**. This tells us which side of the field the possession team is on. I would say this is heavily important, especially since this determines the distance you are from the endzone. Additionally, the **yard line** is listed as a number between 0-50, so we would absolutely need the side to fully determine where the ball is. Therefore, we will remove all rows where we don't have the field position.\n",

    "Currently the **game clock** column shows what the game clock in the stadium shows during the play. In every game, the game clock shows the time remaining in the quarter, so it ranges from 15:00 (15 minutes) down to 00:00 (0 minutes). However, we don't want to represent it like this in the data because it looks like a 24-hour time. A game clock of 14:14 *does not mean* the time is 2:14 PM. It means there is 14 minutes and 14 seconds left in the quarter. \n",
    "\n",
    "How should we change the representation to help our model the most? Thinking about the actual game, there's an important way the game plays out: *At the end of the second quarter (first half), the possession resets itself. Either the other team gets the ball, or a rekick occurs and the same team gets the ball.* Thus, past the 2-minute warning, any running plays that are present will either be draws (like delayed handoffs), or designed runs towards the sidelines in an effort to stop the clock. Of course, runs can also happen close to the goal line but those happen anyways. Given this definition, it seems appropriate that **we should list the game clock as the time remaining until the half.** Thus, it will be in two 30-minute intervals. We can also add a **Half** column, which denotes which half it is. If it's overtime, then we'll say it's the \"3rd\" half."

    "Personnel packages are a huge part of play design. Essentially, an offensive \"package\" mainly tells you how many running backs and tight ends the offense has on the field. Then, given there is (usually) one quarterback and 5 offensive linemen, you can calculate how many wide receivers there are. The \"default\" (subject to coach and team) is 11 (pronounce as the number) personnel, which is **one** running back and **one** tight end, which results in 3 wide recievers. You can have 12 personnel (two tight ends this time), 21 personnel (two RBs and 1 TE), etc. The personnel usually tells you the type of blocking that might happen. For example, if a short gain is needed (3rd and 1), the team might have 13 personnel, for the extra tight ends to provide extra blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defensive personnel work similarly, though there aren't fancy names for them, since the defense always reacts to what the offense does. However, we still include **defensive linemen** (DL), **linebackers** (LB), and cornerbacks/safeties, which gather into **defensive backs** (DB). More defensive backs means the defense is prioritizing speed over raw power and tanks and vice versa if there are more DLs. Linebackers provide a good middle ground, they though they often can't match-up one-on-one with running backs, as the latter are often too fast.\n",

    "So it seems it was a Giants game in Week 5 of the 2019 Season at the 7:00 mark in the 1st quarter, where the rusher rushed for 11 yards. Using Pro-Football-Reference, I've pinpointed the play [here](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/play_finder.cgi?request=1&match=summary_all&year_min=2019&year_max=2019&team_id=nyg&game_type=R&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&week_num_min=5&week_num_max=5&quarter%5B%5D=1&minutes_max=15&seconds_max=0&minutes_min=0&seconds_min=0&down%5B%5D=0&down%5B%5D=1&down%5B%5D=2&down%5B%5D=3&down%5B%5D=4&field_pos_min_field=team&field_pos_max_field=team&end_field_pos_min_field=team&end_field_pos_max_field=team&type%5B%5D=PASS&type%5B%5D=RUSH&type%5B%5D=PUNT&type%5B%5D=KOFF&type%5B%5D=ONSD&type%5B%5D=FG&type%5B%5D=XP&type%5B%5D=2PC&no_play=N&turnover_type%5B%5D=interception&turnover_type%5B%5D=fumble&score_type%5B%5D=touchdown&score_type%5B%5D=field_goal&score_type%5B%5D=safety&rush_direction%5B%5D=LE&rush_direction%5B%5D=LT&rush_direction%5B%5D=LG&rush_direction%5B%5D=M&rush_direction%5B%5D=RG&rush_direction%5B%5D=RT&rush_direction%5B%5D=RE&pass_location%5B%5D=SL&pass_location%5B%5D=SM&pass_location%5B%5D=SR&pass_location%5B%5D=DL&pass_location%5B%5D=DM&pass_location%5B%5D=DR&order_by=yards). Make sure to scroll down to \"Individual Plays\". You can see that the description of the play is \"*Wayne Gallman up the middle for 11 yards (tackle by Anthony Harris and Eric Kendricks) Penalty on MIN: Defensive Too Many Men on Field (Declined)*\". **It was a penalty!** The Vikings had too many men on the field, but the play wasn't called dead, so the result ended up going into the books. In this case, the Vikings were probably confused on what was going on, and so were *not* on high alert when the play occurred. Thus explains why they let a 11-yard play take place when they had 12 men on the field to stop it.\n",

    "So what should we do? Since it's just one play out of the 30 thousand we have, we can just drop it."
