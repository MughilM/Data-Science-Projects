    "I will be participating in the Kaggle competition of ultimately predicting the chances of every possible matchup in the first round of the Division I NCAA tournament. The competition description can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018. The data's description can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data. The description is indeed long but each individual file is relatively simple. However, there are some intricacies involving the tournament. It is all described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament#Current_tournament_format"
