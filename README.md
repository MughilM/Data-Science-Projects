# pl_dvc_structure
This branch is an attempt to bring together all the projects I have done into a single easy-to-consume library.
It will utilize PyTorch Lightning and potentially Data Version Control (DVC) to handle large data files.
Key concepts about the usage of PyTorch Lightning are from the O'Reilly book Deep Learning with PyTorch Lightning.

This is a work in progress.
