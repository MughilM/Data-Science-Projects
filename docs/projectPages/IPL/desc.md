## About

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is an annual cricket league that takes place throughout the country of India. There are 8 teams vying for a trophy at the end of the proceedings. Both international players and local players take part in league-type matchups for around 1 month. It is widely looked forward to each year due to its international recognition and the fact many world-class players compete, rather than small-town domestic leagues in other countries. Due to the nature of the game, it is extremely difficult to forecast the scores in a game, since pitch surface and weather can affect how the ball travels and spins. Nevertheless, I attempt to do this prediction in the notebooks in this section.

## About the Data Used

The data is direct ball-by-ball results starting from the league's inception in 2008 until today. The data itself is taken from Kaggle, a hotbed of various datasets.
