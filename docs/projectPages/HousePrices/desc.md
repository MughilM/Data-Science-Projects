## About

The housing market is extremely fickle. Prices on a single house can fluctuate wildly throughout the year. Additionally, external factors such as location, crime rates, and education in the year can also affect the price of a house. However, most people can agree that the bigger than house is, the more it will cost. In these notebooks I attempt to predict the price of a house given various physical characteristics of the house itself, such as number of bathrooms, square footage of the basement, etc.

## About the Data Used

The house data describes houses in Ames, Iowa, and whose paper is listed [here](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf). The data is taken from a Kaggle "Knowledge" competition at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). This means that there is no direct competition, nor are there monetary prizes involved. However, there is still a leaderboard for the most accurate models. Users can submit files or work on local kernels. The emphasis in this type of entry is learning from other Kagglers through discussion boards and the like. See [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) to see data and variable descriptions.
